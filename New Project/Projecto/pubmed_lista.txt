In this retrospective study, we analyzed trends of syphilis prevalence in patient groups attending our tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The data was obtained by reviewing laboratory records of the STD laboratory from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2011. Cases positive by both Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) and Treponema pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) tests were analyzed for seroprevalence of syphilis in different groups, and to analyze the rising or falling trends, if any. RESULTS: A total of 28,920 serum samples were received in the 6-year study period for VDRL testing, of which 972 (3.4%) were found to be reactive. Of these, 1722 sera were also submitted for TPPA testing, 374 (21.7%) of which were positive. A total of 375 samples were submitted for both tests, indicating biological false positivity of 0.27%. A rising trend, though not statistically significant, was observed in pregnant women, drug users and patients from wards/out-patient departments, while a statistically significant rise in prevalence of syphilis was found in HIV-positive individuals. A falling trend (not statistically significant) was observed in STD clinic attendees. CONCLUSION: An increasing trend of syphilis was observed during the study period when all groups were analyzed together, especially in HIV-seropositive individuals, which calls for continued and sustained efforts for case detection, treatment, and preventive measures to contain the disease.', 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'IP': '2', 'DP': '2015 Jul-Dec', 'LR': '20151224', 'VI': '36', 'OT': ['Epidemiology', 'India', 'seroprevalence', 'syphilis', 'trends'], 'PMID': '26692604', 'FAU': ['Sethi, Sunil', 'Mewara, Abhishek', 'Hallur, Vinaykumar', 'Prasad, Amber', 'Sharma, Kusum', 'Raj, Atul'], 'AU': ['Sethi S', 'Mewara A', 'Hallur V', 'Prasad A', 'Sharma K', 'Raj A'], 'DCOM': '20151222', 'SO': 'Indian J Sex Transm Dis. 2015 Jul-Dec;36(2):140-3. doi: 10.4103/0253-7184.167137.', 'PST': 'ppublish', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'IS': '0253-7184 (Print) 0253-7184 (Linking)', 'PMC': 'PMC4660552', 'TA': 'Indian J Sex Transm Dis', 'TI': 'Rising trends of syphilis in a tertiary care center in North India.', 'OWN': 'PIP', 'OID': ['NLM: PMC4660552'], 'MHDA': '2015/12/23 06:01', 'AD': 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.

Because Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the infectious agent of syphilis, is yet uncultivated in vitro, diagnosis is usually made using serology; however, in cases where serology is inconclusive or in patients with immunosuppression where these tests may be difficult to interpret, the availability of a molecular tool for direct diagnosis may be of pivotal importance. Here we present a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay that simultaneously identifies and analyzes spatial distribution of T. pallidum in histological tissue sections. For this assay the species-specific FISH probe TPALL targeting the 16S rRNA of T. pallidum was designed in silico and evaluated using T. pallidum infected rabbit testicular tissue and a panel of non-syphilis spirochetes as positive and negative controls, respectively, before application to samples from four syphilis-patients. In a HIV positive patient, FISH showed the presence of T. pallidum in inguinal lymph node tissue. In a patient not suspected to suffer from syphilis but underwent surgery for phimosis, numerous T. pallidum cells were found in preputial tissue. In two cases with oral involvement, FISH was able to differentiate T. pallidum from oral treponemes and showed infection of the oral mucosa and tonsils, respectively. The TPALL FISH probe is now readily available for in situ identification of T. pallidum in selected clinical samples as well as T. pallidum research applications and animal models.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2015 Elsevier GmbH.

Although several other species in the genus are able to cause or contribute to disease, T. pallidum differs in that it is able to rapidly disseminate via the bloodstream to tissue sites distant from the site of initial infection. It is also the only Treponema species able to cross both the blood-brain and placental barriers. Previously, the T. pallidum proteins, Tp0750 and Tp0751 (also called pallilysin), were shown to degrade host proteins central to blood coagulation and basement membrane integrity, suggesting a role for these proteins in T. pallidum dissemination and tissue invasion. In the present study, we characterized Tp0750 and Tp0751 sequence variation in a diversity of pathogenic and nonpathogenic treponemes. We also determined the proteolytic potential of the orthologs from the less invasive species Treponema denticola and Treponema phagedenis. These analyses showed high levels of sequence similarity among Tp0750 orthologs from pathogenic species. For pallilysin, lower levels of sequence conservation were observed between this protein and orthologs from other treponemes, except for the ortholog from the highly invasive rabbit venereal syphilis-causing Treponema paraluiscuniculi. In vitro host component binding and degradation assays demonstrated that pallilysin and Tp0750 orthologs from the less invasive treponemes tested were not capable of binding or degrading host proteins. The results show that pallilysin and Tp0750 host protein binding and degradative capability is positively correlated with treponemal invasiveness.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

This phenomenon, known as phase variation, causes rapid activation or silencing of gene expression and fosters bacterial adaptation to new or changing environments. Phase variation often occurs in surface-exposed proteins, and in Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the syphilis agent, it was reported to affect transcription of three putative outer membrane protein (OMP)-encoding genes. When the T. pallidum subsp. pallidum Nichols strain genome was initially annotated, the TP0126 open reading frame was predicted to include a poly(G) tract and did not appear to have a predicted signal sequence that might suggest the possibility of its being an OMP. Here we show that the initial annotation was incorrect, that this poly(G) is instead located within the TP0126 promoter, and that it varies in length in vivo during experimental syphilis. Additionally, we show that TP0126 transcription is affected by changes in the poly(G) length consistent with regulation by phase variation. In silico analysis of the TP0126 open reading frame based on the experimentally identified transcriptional start site shortens this hypothetical protein by 69 amino acids, reveals a predicted cleavable signal peptide, and suggests structural homology with the OmpW family of porins. Circular dichroism of recombinant TP0126 supports structural homology to OmpW. Together with the evidence that TP0126 is fully conserved among T. pallidum subspecies and strains, these data suggest an important role for TP0126 in T. pallidum biology and syphilis pathogenesis.', 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

It was first reported at the end of the 15th century in Europe. Infections may be sexually transmitted as well as spread from an infected mother to her fetus or through blood transfusions. The laboratory diagnosis of syphilis infection is complex. Because this organism cannot be cultured, serology is used as the principal diagnostic method. Some of the issues related to serological diagnoses are that antibodies take time to appear after infection, and serology screening tests require several secondary confirmatory tests that can produce complex results needing interpretation by experts in the field. Traditionally, syphilis screening was performed using either rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests, and confirmed by treponemal tests such as MHA-TP, TPPA or FTA-Abs. Currently, that trend is reversed, ie, most of the laboratories in Canada now screen for syphilis using treponemal enzyme immunoassays and confirm the status of infection using rapid plasma reagin or Venereal Disease Research Laboratory tests; this approach is often referred to as the reverse algorithm. This chapter reviews guidelines for specimen types and sample collection, treponemal and non-treponemal tests utilized in Canada, the current status of serological tests for syphilis in Canada, the complexity of serological diagnosis of syphilis infection and serological testing algorithms. Both traditional and reverse sequence algorithms are recommended and the algorithm used should be based on a combination of local disease epidemiology, test volumes, performance of the proposed assays and available resources.', 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'MHDA': '2015/03/24 06:01', 'DP': '2015 Jan-Feb', 'LR': '20151029', 'VI': '26 Suppl A', 'OT': ['Enzyme immunoassay', 'RPR', 'Reverse algorithm', 'Serological diagnosis', 'Syphilis', 'Treponema pallidum'], 'PMID': '25798165', 'FAU': ['Levett, Paul N', 'Fonseca, Kevin', 'Tsang, Raymond Sw', 'Kadkhoda, Kamran', 'Serhir, Bouchra', 'Radons, Sandra M', 'Morshed, Muhammad'], 'AU': ['Levett PN', 'Fonseca K', 'Tsang RS', 'Kadkhoda K', 'Serhir B', 'Radons SM', 'Morshed M'], 'DCOM': '20150323', 'SO': 'Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2015 Jan-Feb;26 Suppl A:6A-12A.', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'IS': '1712-9532 (Print) 1712-9532 (Linking)', 'PMC': 'PMC4353981', 'TA': 'Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol', 'TI': 'Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network laboratory guidelines for the use of serological tests (excluding point-of-care tests) for the diagnosis of syphilis in Canada.', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'OID': ['NLM: PMC4353981'], 'AD': 'Saskatchewan Disease Control Laboratory, Regina, Saskatchewan; Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health, Calgary, Alberta; National Microbiology Laboratory; Cadham Provincial Laboratory; ; Department of Medical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases and Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba; Institut national de sante publique du Quebec-LSPQ, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec; Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network, Winnipeg, Manitoba; BC Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory; ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia.', 'PL': 'Canada', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'DA': '20150323'}{'OAB': ['Publisher: Abstract available from the publisher.'], 'OABL': ['fre'], 'JID': '101226876', 'PST': 'ppublish', 'JT': 'The Canadian journal of infectious diseases & medical microbiology = Journal canadien des maladies infectieuses et de la microbiologie medicale / AMMI Canada', 'PG': '13A-7A', 'LA': ['eng'], 'CRDT': ['2015/03/24 06:00'], 'EDAT': '2015/03/24 06:00', 'AB': 'Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum and/or its nucleic acid can be detected by various methods such as microscopy, rabbit infectivity test or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. The rabbit infectivity test for T. pallidum, although very sensitive, has been discontinued from most laboratories due to ethical issues related to the need for animal inoculation with live T. pallidum, the technically demanding procedure and long turnaround time for results, thus making it impractical for routine diagnostic use. Dark-field and phase-contrast microscopy are still useful at clinic- or hospital-based laboratories for near-bedside detection of T. pallidum in genital, skin or mucous lesions although their availability is decreasing. The lack of reliable and specific anti-T. pallidum antibodies and its inferior sensitivity to PCR may explain why the direct fluorescent antibody test for T. pallidum is not widely available for clinical use. Immunohistochemical staining for T. pallidum also depends on the availability of specific antibodies, and the method is only applicable for histopathological examination of biopsy and autopsy specimens necessitating an invasive specimen collection approach. With recent advances in molecular diagnostics, PCR is considered to be the most reliable, versatile and practical for laboratories to implement. In addition to being an objective and sensitive test for direct detection of Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum DNA in skin and mucous membrane lesions, the resulting PCR amplicons from selected gene targets can be further characterized for antimicrobial (macrolide) susceptibility testing, strain typing and identification of T. pallidum subspecies.', 'PT': ['Journal Article'], 'MHDA': '2015/03/24 06:01', 'DP': '2015 Jan-Feb', 'LR': '20151029', 'VI': '26 Suppl A', 'OT': ['Direct detection', 'PCR', 'Syphilis', 'Treponema pallidum'], 'PMID': '25798160', 'FAU': ['Tsang, Raymond Sw', 'Morshed, Muhammad', 'Chernesky, Max A', 'Jayaraman, Gayatri C', 'Kadkhoda, Kamran'], 'AU': ['Tsang RS', 'Morshed M', 'Chernesky MA', 'Jayaraman GC', 'Kadkhoda K'], 'DCOM': '20150323', 'SO': 'Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol. 2015 Jan-Feb;26 Suppl A:13A-7A.', 'STAT': 'PubMed-not-MEDLINE', 'IS': '1712-9532 (Print) 1712-9532 (Linking)', 'PMC': 'PMC4353979', 'TA': 'Can J Infect Dis Med Microbiol', 'TI': 'Canadian Public Health Laboratory Network laboratory guidelines for the use of direct tests to detect syphilis in Canada.', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'OID': ['NLM: PMC4353979'], 'AD': 'National Microbiology Laboratory, Public Health Agency of Canada, Winnipeg, Manitoba; BC Public Health Microbiology and Reference Laboratory; ; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia; McMaster University, Hamilton; Centre for Communicable Diseases and Infection Control, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario; Cadham Provincial Laboratory; ; Department of Medical Microbiology & Infectious Diseases and Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba.', 'PL': 'Canada', 'OTO': ['NOTNLM'], 'DA': '20150323'}{'GR': ['R01 AI-42143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI042143/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'], 'LID': '10.1371/journal.pntd.0003662 [doi]', 'JT': 'PLoS neglected tropical diseases', 'PG': 'e0003662', 'LA': ['eng'], 'AID': ['10.1371/journal.pntd.0003662 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-15-00038 [pii]'], 'SB': 'IM', 'CRDT': ['2015/03/21 06:00'], 'AB': "Adherence-mediated colonization plays an important role in pathogenesis of microbial infections, particularly those caused by extracellular pathogens responsible for systemic diseases, such as Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum (T. pallidum), the agent of syphilis. Among T. pallidum adhesins, TP0136 is known to bind fibronectin (Fn), an important constituent of the host extracellular matrix. To deepen our understanding of the TP0136-Fn interaction dynamics, we used two naturally-occurring sequence variants of the TP0136 protein to investigate which region of the protein is responsible for Fn binding, and whether TP0136 would adhere to human cellular Fn in addition to plasma Fn and super Fn as previously reported. Fn binding assays were performed with recombinant proteins representing the two full-length TP0136 variants and their discrete regions. As a complementary approach, we tested inhibition of T. pallidum binding to Fn by recombinant full-length TP0136 proteins and fragments, as well as by anti-TP0136 immune sera. Our results show that TP0136 adheres more efficiently to cellular Fn than to plasma Fn, that the TP0136 NH2-terminal conserved region of the protein is primarily responsible for binding to plasma Fn but that binding sites for cellular Fn are also present in the protein's central and COOH-terminal regions. Additionally, message quantification studies show that tp0136 is highly transcribed during experimental infection, and that its message level increases in parallel to the host immune pressure on the pathogen, which suggests a possible role for this protein in T. pallidum persistence. In a time where syphilis incidence is high, our data will help in the quest to identify suitable targets for development of a much needed vaccine against this important disease.", 'PT': ['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', "Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"], 'IP': '3', 'DP': '2015 Mar', 'LR': '20150411', 'VI': '9', 'EDAT': '2015/03/21 06:00', 'PMID': '25793702', 'FAU': ['Ke, Wujian', 'Molini, Barbara J', 'Lukehart, Sheila A', 'Giacani, Lorenzo'], 'PMC': 'PMC4368718', 'AU': ['Ke W', 'Molini BJ', 'Lukehart SA', 'Giacani L'], 'JID': '101291488', 'SO': 'PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2015 Mar 20;9(3):e0003662. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0003662. eCollection 2015 Mar.', 'PST': 'epublish', 'STAT': 'In-Process', 'IS': '1935-2735 (Electronic) 1935-2727 (Linking)', 'DEP': '20150320', 'PHST': ['2015/03 [ecollection]', '2015/01/09 [received]', '2015/02/28 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 [epublish]'], 'TA': 'PLoS Negl Trop Dis', 'TI': 'Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum TP0136 protein is heterogeneous among isolates and binds cellular and plasma fibronectin via its NH2-terminal end.', 'OWN': 'NLM', 'OID': ['NLM: PMC4368718'], 'MHDA': '2015/03/21 06:00', 'AD': 'Department of Medicine, Division of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, University of Washington, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America; Graduate School, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, PR China; Division of STD, Guangdong Provincial Center for STI & Skin Diseases Control and Prevention, Guangzhou, PR China.

Clinical symptoms of syphilis and bejel are overlapping and the epidemiological context is important for correct diagnosis of both diseases. In contrast to syphilis, caused by T. pallidum subsp. pallidum (TPA), TEN infections are usually spread by direct contact or contaminated utensils rather than by sexual contact. Bejel is most often seen in western Africa and in the Middle East. The strain Bosnia A was isolated in 1950 in Bosnia, southern Europe. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The complete genome of the Bosnia A strain was amplified and sequenced using the pooled segment genome sequencing (PSGS) method and a combination of three next-generation sequencing techniques (SOLiD, Roche 454, and Illumina). Using this approach, a total combined average genome coverage of 513x was achieved. The size of the Bosnia A genome was found to be 1,137,653 bp, i.e. 1.6-2.8 kbp shorter than any previously published genomes of uncultivable pathogenic treponemes. Conserved gene synteny was found in the Bosnia A genome compared to other sequenced syphilis and yaws treponemes. The TEN Bosnia A genome was distinct but very similar to the genome of yaws-causing T. pallidum subsp. pertenue (TPE) strains. Interestingly, the TEN Bosnia A genome was found to contain several sequences, which so far, have been uniquely identified only in syphilis treponemes. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The genome of TEN Bosnia A contains several sequences thought to be unique to TPA strains; these sequences very likely represent remnants of recombination events during the evolution of TEN treponemes.

OBJECTIVE: The study is designed to assess the effectiveness of PCR testing and serological methods in the diagnosis of Treponema pallidum subsp pallidum among blood donors in Burkina Faso. METHODS: The study included 6375 samples of volunteer blood donors from the regional blood transfusion center of Ouagadougou (CRTS/O). Among samples, 183 positive and 59 negative in RPR were analyzed to detect antibodies anti-T. pallidum subsp pallidum with a immunoassay method (CMIA) and were confirmed using the Polymerase Chain Reaction testing. RESULTS: In RPR, we obtained a prevalence rate of 2.9% (183/6375) for treponematosis. From the 183 RPR+ specimen, 108 (59%) were found CMIA+ and 11 (6%) were confirmed PCR+. While the 59 pattern RPR-; 31 (52.5%) were CMIA + including 3 (5.1%) tested PCR+. Seventy-five (75) samples RPR + /CMIA-; 2 (2.7%) were confirmed positive by PCR. All 28 samples RPR-/CMIA- were confirmed negative by PCR. CONCLUSION: PCR testing confirmed a low distribution of T. pallidum subsp pallidum in comparison to serological methods.

Despite inexpensive and effective antibiotic therapy, syphilis remains a prevalent disease in developing countries and has re-emerged as a public health threat in developed nations. In addition to the medical burden imparted by infectious syphilis, congenital syphilis is considered the most significant infectious disease affecting fetuses and newborns worldwide, and individuals afflicted with syphilis have an enhanced risk for HIV transmission and acquisition. The global disease burden of syphilis and failure of decades of public health efforts to stem the incidence of disease highlight the need for an effective syphilis vaccine. Although challenges associated with T. pallidum research have impeded understanding of this pathogen, the existence of a relevant animal model has enabled insight into the correlates of disease protection. Complete protection against infection has been achieved in the animal model using an extended immunization regimen of gamma-irradiated T. pallidum, demonstrating the importance of treponemal surface components in generation of protective immunity and the feasibility of syphilis vaccine development. Syphilis is a prime candidate for development of a successful vaccine due to the (1) research community's accumulated knowledge of immune correlates of protection; (2) existence of a relevant animal model that enables effective pre-clinical analyses; (3) universal penicillin susceptibility of T. pallidum which enhances the attractiveness of clinical vaccine trials; and (4) significant public health benefit a vaccine would have on reduction of infectious/congenital syphilis and HIV rates. Critical personnel, research and market gaps need to be addressed before the goal of a syphilis vaccine can be realized, including recruitment of additional researchers to the T. pallidum research field with a proportional increase in research funding, attainment of a definitive understanding of correlates of protection in humans, and engagement of industry/funding partnerships for syphilis vaccine production.", 'CI': ['Copyright (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
