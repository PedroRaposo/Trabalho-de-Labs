The objective of this work was to apply bioinformatic tools in the analysis of a bacteria. 

The chosen strain was Treponema pallidum subsp. Pallidum str.Nichols, a gram negative a spirochaete bacterium, with approximately 1000 genes enclosed in a circular genome. The NCBI RefSeq accession number used was NC_000919 (GI:15638995).
Furthermore, we only analysed a set of 100 genes comprised between TP_RS02955 TA TP_RS03535 (locus tag), genome area 639851 to 765100.


This bacterium causes treponemal diseases such as syphilis, bejel, pinta, and yaws. This is a cause of concern because of the probability of transmission of disease, especially because the drugs used will become obsolete.
