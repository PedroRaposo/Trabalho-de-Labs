The main class that controls a big chunk of python scripts. (Files Data , Gene and Connector, an image labelled "Architecture.png" 
has a simple graphic description of this classes and their relation with other parts of this project )
Comments of procedure and information in this file will be of this type #--
Comments with only # are methods that can be commented/uncommented according to necessity
There are some files that we only need to print once, for debug or make intermediary analyses or for small scripts not controlled from this main file.
